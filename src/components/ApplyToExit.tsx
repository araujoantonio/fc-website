              <p>
                On our discovery call we'll get to know you better, we want to understand a bit about the business and it's history, and also about what has you looking forward to the future after your exit.
              </p>
              <p>
                The call will be a chance to communicate in transparency with each other, to get down to the facts and understand if the deal could be a win/win.
              </p>
              <p>
                In this call we'll have had a chance to review your business data already, so we'll do some back of-napkin-math and collaborate together to find a deal structure that could make sense for both of us.

              Once we're able to agree on a fair Price &amp; Terms, we'll write up an Offer in the form of a Letter Of Intent (to buy your business), and send it within the same day we make a verbal agreement. Once it's signed and countersigned, we'll start the Due Diligence process.

                This simply means our team will conduct a comprehensive appraisal of the business. Our mission is to validate all of the data points that were provided in the initial application.
              </p>
              <p>
                We'll use this time to validate the necessary components are present to meet our investment criteria, and we'll confirm our strategy on how we'll grow the business and continue to add value to the marketplace with it.
              </p>
              <p>
                During this process Freeborn Capital will also begin to design and implement the plan for how the business operations will continue after the transition. This may involve aligning current key Management team members to stay and continue to build with us. This process sets the stage for a successful exit for you, and enables us to responsibly continue the legacy of the business and it's service to employees and customers.

              <p>
                The purpose of Due Diligence is to allow us to confirm that our risk is mitigated, a key advantage to Freeborn Capital's process is that Due Diligence can be sped up by mitigating risk through terms that only we can offer, which balance the risk of the purchase. This allows us to speed up Due Diligence, whereas many business buyers will take as long as possible in this stage.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may have had experience with this type of business buyer, whose strategy is to demoralize the seller (aka you) into accepting a smaller price, only after spending what could add up to years in Due Diligence. Freeborn Capital offers a new opportunity to the market: In most cases we are able to offer terms for an expedited exit in order to make it as simple and fast as possible for you to move toward what you want for your future.

              <p className="font-medium text-text-on-light">
                Our philosophy is: the faster we can all move forward, the better for you, for the customers and for the employees means better for us.

              As we near the end of the Due Diligence phase, our team will draft up the final closing documents based on everything we've mutually agreed. We'll send every document to you for review and reach mutual agreement on any adjustments that need to be made to Price or Terms based on any potential discrepancy we might have discovered in the actual business results as we reviewed it in Due Diligence.

                When everything looks perfect for both sides, we'll arrange plans for how we'll transfer ownership of all business assets. Then we'll set a date for the final closing meeting with the sellers team (you) and Freeborn Capital. This meeting might take several hours since there will be lots of paperwork to sign. At this meeting we'll do final review together before we sign all the closing documents.
              </p>
              <p>
                From there ownership will transfer through contract and initial payment will transfer through escrow, and you'll be paid based on the arrangements we agreed on and the deal is done.
